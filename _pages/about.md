I am a macroeconomist with a focus on development and economic growth. My research uses macroeconomic theory to study market frictions that are prevalent in developing economies—particularly labor informality—and how these frictions shape the behavior of workers and firms. I am especially interested in the interaction between labor markets and firm dynamics, and in the aggregate implications of these micro-level distortions.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. In 2025 I was awarded the [Yiran Fan Memorial Prize](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/yiran-fan-memorial-conference). Previously, I worked as a Research Specialist for [Professor Ufuk Akcigit](https://www.ufukakcigit.com/) at the University of Chicago, Senior Researcher at [Quantil S.A.S](https://quantil.co/en/), and the Central Bank of Colombia. My full experience is available in my CV [here](/files/pdf/JMQ_CV.pdf).
