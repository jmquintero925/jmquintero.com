Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. 

My research focus on misallocation, economic growth and development. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Specialist for [Professor Ufuk Akcigit](https://www.ufukakcigit.com/) at The University of Chicago, Senior Researcher at [Qunatil S.A.S](https://quantil.co/en/), and the Central Bank of Colombia. My full experience is available in my CV [here](/files/pdf/Quintero_CV_01-2024.pdf).

You can reach me at [jmquintero925@uchicago.edu](jmquintero925@uchicago.edu) or through any of the sidebar links to the left.
