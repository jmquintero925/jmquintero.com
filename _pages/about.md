Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. 

My research focuses on Macroeconomics with particular interest in misallocation of resources, economic growth and development. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Specialist for [Professor Ufuk Akcigit](https://www.ufukakcigit.com/) at the University of Chicago, Senior Researcher at [Quantil S.A.S](https://quantil.co/en/), and the Central Bank of Colombia. My full experience is available in my CV [here](/files/pdf/JMQ_CV.pdf). 

You can reach me at [jmquintero925@uchicago.edu](mailto:jmquintero925@uchicago.edu) or through any of the sidebar links to the left.
